# Chapter 2: Statistical Learning

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of **Statistical Learning** — the foundation of modern supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## Overview

- What is Statistical Learning?  
  Understanding the relationship between input variables (predictors) and output variables (responses).

- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning  
  Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data.

- The Trade-off Between Accuracy and Interpretability  
  Balancing complex, accurate models with simpler, more interpretable ones.

- Assessing Model Accuracy  
  Metrics such as training error, test error, bias, and variance.

- The Bias-Variance Trade-off  
  Explains how model complexity affects prediction error.
