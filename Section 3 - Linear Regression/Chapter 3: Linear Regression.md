- Multiple Linear Regression
- Statistical significance of coefficients (t-tests, p-values)
- Model evaluation metrics: \( R^2 \), Residual Standard Error (RSE), F-statistics
- Assumptions of the linear model
- Non-linearity, interactions, and transformations
- Comparison with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Key Libraries
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
