# Chapter 4: Classification Models â€“ Summary & Notes

This repository contains a summary guide and annotated notes based on **Chapter 4: Classification** from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python*. It explores various supervised classification techniques, their strengths, weaknesses, and best-fit scenarios.

## Overview

- Introduction to classification and why linear regression isn't suitable
- Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes, and KNN explained
- Pros, cons, assumptions, and real-world applications
- Model comparison and selection guidelines

## Key Concepts

- **Logistic Regression** â€“ Best for interpretability (e.g., predicting patient risk)
- **LDA** â€“ Great for small datasets with normally distributed features
- **QDA** â€“ More flexible boundaries, good with more data
- **Naive Bayes** â€“ Excellent for text and high-dimensional data
- **KNN** â€“ Non-parametric, effective in low dimensions

## ðŸ§ª Libraries Mentioned

- `scikit-learn` â€“ Modeling and evaluation
- `pandas` â€“ Data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ Visualizations
- `numpy` â€“ Numerical operations
